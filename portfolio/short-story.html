      <p class="fsize2">
        Single tear falls from the face of the Earth; the pain that has lingered in your heart is finally vanquished from all lies, stereotypes, and hypocrites. In life you’ll be faced with many repetitive moments where someone has wronged you; to you it’s infallible that you could forgive them for making the error that all humans have which is: we’re not perfect. It’s up to you… and only you to make that remarkable trait that is also instilled in each human which is: forgiveness.
