        I am a current senior at the University of Miami with a passion for writing. I remember when I was younger and was enthusiastic about just putting the pen to paper.

      <p class="fsize">
        I am very intrigued with using nature and spiritual guidance throughout my writing it feels like it necessary for me to blend two things that I view important for my life.
      </p>

      <p class="fsize">
        My goal for this page is to encourage others to actually write just a little or a lot if you feel up to it. I really hope you like these few works here. Sit back, relax, and write!
